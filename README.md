# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a classic and popular video game where the player maneuvers a dot, growing it by 'eating' pieces of food. As the snake grows, it becomes both a challenge and an obstacle. The goal is to grow the snake as large as possible without colliding with the walls or itself, which results in the end of the game.

This project is a multiplayer take on the traditional Snake game, adding an extra layer of excitement.

Before running this client, make sure you have the server side up and running. You can download and install the server from [here](https://github.com/example/snek-server).
